- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie

#### Approach

---

This game uses a constant variable to assign it an array of arrays of all possible winning combinations.

```
const winCombinations = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9],
  [1, 5, 9],
  [3, 5, 7],
];
```

The game is then built on functions that work to start the game, check whether there's a winner or a tie at each click, and reset the game or score board.

#### Winner solution

---

Each clicked box's index is extracted and pushed into an array representing either PlayerX's or PlayerO's clicks. Both arrays are then looped through (using some(), every(), & includes() methods),and checked for matches with any of the winning combinations arrays.

```
let playerOWon = winCombinations.some((combination) => {
    return combination.every((number) => {
      return playerO.includes(number);
    });
```

The first one that matches, results in a gameOver = true, preventing additional clicks; a message displaying the winner; and an updated scoreboard. A tie message is displayed in cases of no winner.

```
if (playerXWon) {
    playerTurn.innerHTML = "<span class='item-x'>X</span> WON üèÜ";
    playerXScore++;
    document.querySelector(".playerX").innerHTML = `X's Score: ${playerXScore}`;
    gameOver = true;
```

#### Challenges

---

- Finding the right solutions for the winning combinations.
- Re-factoring the code, still work to be done on that
- Knowing the right places to place variables in within the function; and also where in the code a function should be called

#### Bugs

---

- Site _*almost*_ fully response
  - the issue is I was not able to remove the hover effects on mobile / tablet versions
  - should work more the size adjustment for smaller screens

#### Future improvements

---

- General style of the game can be improved
- Add confetti animations once a there is a winner
- Adding an AI
- Using Local Storage to keep data locally
- Customize tokens
- Re-do the whole game using OOP

#### Key takeaways

---

To not spend endless hours on things that are not nearly as important for the beginning. Rather focus on a working MVP, and then slowly adding more features.
